    "Music is grounded in *a priori* structures of human experience, so it goes. In essence, music is one of the most universal and accessible ways humans, and societies as a whole, encounter emotion and being. As Tomas Clifton describes in their work *Music and the a Priori*, musical experience contains its own form of understanding that is **immediately given** while listening<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). These structuures are given in forms such as temporal flow, tension, and expectation, which are conditions of our existing in the world; They are not learned. It is because of this that we can call music a type of emotional landcape- A landscape that reveals how we experience and inhabit time, how we move through feeling, and how our inner states are susceptible to shift moment to moment, song-to-song. \n",
    "\n",
    "This persnal and deep connection between human emotion and music could offer an explanation for why some songs are described as energetic, uplifting, depressing, or calming<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). This account ***humanizes*** these labels, reflecting on how the music resonates with our own experiental structures, rather than seeming correlational and abstract. For example, faster tempos tend to evoke feelings of being upbeat or energetic while slower tempos can feel more calming or melancholic. Additionally, valence could lead us to label a song as either sad or happy, seemingly from our own intuition. Clifton's paper helps explain this intuitiveness, where music is directly tied to emotional meaning through structures that shape our experience of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "The major point that our research project aims to address is the fact that emotional experience does not stay constant throughout the year. In the past couple decades, we have better come to understand environmental psychology by studying how seasonal changes in daylight, temperature, and daily routines can influence mood and motivation. The most obvious example of this comes from the term **winter depression**, a.k.a. Seasonal Affective Disorder. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Yale School of Medicine describes, SAD is characterized by dperessed mood, decreased enjoyment of activities, sadness, poor energy, and decreased confidence. Most importantly for our research question, through questionaires they note that roughly 90% of people claim to report changes in energy, modd, sleep, and apetite in the winter<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). This pattern typically starts in fall, seemingly creating a pattern of a rise and decline of mood and emotion that mimicks the dynamics of music itself with the cycles of intensity, valence, and tone that rise and fall over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pettijohn et al. (2010) Music for the Seasons: Seasonal Music Preferences in College Students** is a central piece of prior work that directly links seasons to musical preference. In their paper, they describe two studies with undergraduate participants, where students were primed to have different seasons in mind. In the first study, they used a winter vs. summer reading scenario, and in the second they had students write about their own fall, winter, spring, or summer experiences. They then reported their preffered types of music, where the results supported the researchers' hypotheses that seasonal context would shift preferences toward reflexive and complex music in fall and winter, and toward energetic and upbeat music for spring and summer<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). This paper provides a strong foundation for investigating whether large-scale music trends from the Billboard Top100 also follow this shift from across different seasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is, however, some opposition to this theory. **Winthorst et al. (2020) Seasonality of mood and affect in a large general population sample** is a clear counter example to our premise- that seasons influence mood. The researchers studied mood and emotional well-being in adults to see if there were real differences in mood across the seasons. They measured positive and negative affect and depressive symptoms using questionaires. They found that season-to-season differences were very small and the evidence was not strong enough to say that seasons dramatically change mood for the great majority of people. The only meaningful effect was due to the personality trait neuroticism, but with only modest effects<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5). This, very clearly, seems to contradict our earlier claim on which we based our research project. While we cannot directly test to confirm or reject their findings, if our results yield a difference of audio features that simmilarly match the findings of Pettijohn et al. (2010), then we may be able to assume some relationship between the two. \n",

    "\n",
    "The ideal dataset for answering our research question would include weekly Billboard Hot 100 chart data combined with musical audio features for each song, including valence, tempo, and energy. The main variables needed from the Billboard dataset include song title, artist name, chart release date, chart position during a specific week, peak chart position, and number of weeks on the chart. These variables allow us to track song popularity and performance across time and the seasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "To properly study seasonal trends, the dataset would need a large number of observations collected over many years. Ideally, the dataset would include every Billboard Hot 100 chart from 1958 to the present. Since each chart has 100 songs and is released weekly, this would give us thousands of data points, which helps make our results more reliable and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data would be collected by combining historical Billboard chart data with music feature metadata gathered through music databases. Billboard chart data is compiled using music sales, radio play, and streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data would be stored in a table format like a csv. Each row would represent a song appearing on a specific chart week. Columns would include different  chart performance variables, song identification variables, seasonal classification (winter, spring, summer, fall), and audio features such as valence, tempo, and energy. This structure allows us to go through the data fast enough and to cbe able to compare in between seasons.\n",

However, this dataset needs to be cleaned and converted into table format before we go through it and analyze.\n",
