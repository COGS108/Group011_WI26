    "Music is grounded in *a priori* structures of human experience, so it goes. In essence, music is one of the most universal and accessible ways humans, and societies as a whole, encounter emotion and being. As Tomas Clifton describes in their work *Music and the a Priori*, musical experience contains its own form of understanding that is **immediately given** while listening<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). These structuures are given in forms such as temporal flow, tension, and expectation, which are conditions of our existing in the world; They are not learned. It is because of this that we can call music a type of emotional landcape- A landscape that reveals how we experience and inhabit time, how we move through feeling, and how our inner states are susceptible to shift moment to moment, song-to-song. \n",
    "\n",
    "This persnal and deep connection between human emotion and music could offer an explanation for why some songs are described as energetic, uplifting, depressing, or calming<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). This account ***humanizes*** these labels, reflecting on how the music resonates with our own experiental structures, rather than seeming correlational and abstract. For example, faster tempos tend to evoke feelings of being upbeat or energetic while slower tempos can feel more calming or melancholic. Additionally, valence could lead us to label a song as either sad or happy, seemingly from our own intuition. Clifton's paper helps explain this intuitiveness, where music is directly tied to emotional meaning through structures that shape our experience of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "The major point that our research project aims to address is the fact that emotional experience does not stay constant throughout the year. In the past couple decades, we have better come to understand environmental psychology by studying how seasonal changes in daylight, temperature, and daily routines can influence mood and motivation. The most obvious example of this comes from the term **winter depression**, a.k.a. Seasonal Affective Disorder. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Yale School of Medicine describes, SAD is characterized by dperessed mood, decreased enjoyment of activities, sadness, poor energy, and decreased confidence. Most importantly for our research question, through questionaires they note that roughly 90% of people claim to report changes in energy, modd, sleep, and apetite in the winter<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). This pattern typically starts in fall, seemingly creating a pattern of a rise and decline of mood and emotion that mimicks the dynamics of music itself with the cycles of intensity, valence, and tone that rise and fall over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pettijohn et al. (2010) Music for the Seasons: Seasonal Music Preferences in College Students** is a central piece of prior work that directly links seasons to musical preference. In their paper, they describe two studies with undergraduate participants, where students were primed to have different seasons in mind. In the first study, they used a winter vs. summer reading scenario, and in the second they had students write about their own fall, winter, spring, or summer experiences. They then reported their preffered types of music, where the results supported the researchers' hypotheses that seasonal context would shift preferences toward reflexive and complex music in fall and winter, and toward energetic and upbeat music for spring and summer<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). This paper provides a strong foundation for investigating whether large-scale music trends from the Billboard Top100 also follow this shift from across different seasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is, however, some opposition to this theory. **Winthorst et al. (2020) Seasonality of mood and affect in a large general population sample** is a clear counter example to our premise- that seasons influence mood. The researchers studied mood and emotional well-being in adults to see if there were real differences in mood across the seasons. They measured positive and negative affect and depressive symptoms using questionaires. They found that season-to-season differences were very small and the evidence was not strong enough to say that seasons dramatically change mood for the great majority of people. The only meaningful effect was due to the personality trait neuroticism, but with only modest effects<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5). This, very clearly, seems to contradict our earlier claim on which we based our research project. While we cannot directly test to confirm or reject their findings, if our results yield a difference of audio features that simmilarly match the findings of Pettijohn et al. (2010), then we may be able to assume some relationship between the two. \n",

    "We expect a moderate correlation between music preferences and seasonal mood variation. As people's mood and energy change with the seasons, they often choose music that matches how they feel or helps manage their emotions. As a result, music listened to in winter (when moods are generally lower) tends to have lower tempo, valence, and energy, while music listened to in the summer (when moods are higher) tends to be more energetic, have a higher tempo, and higher valence."

    "\n",
    "The Spotify audio features dataset provides a matching set of quantitative measurements that describe the musical and acoustic properties of unique tracks. These features are produced by Spotify's internal data and algorithmic analysis to extract standardized metrics. For this project, our primary focus in three variables- valence, energy, and tempo- which captures different dimensions of musical expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Valence and Energy are unitless scores ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, where valence represents the \"positivity\" of a track and energy measures intesnity and activity level of the track. Songs with high valence will sound happy and/or cheerful, while high-energy songs will feel loud, fast, and dynamic. Tempo is measured in units of beats oer minute (BPM) and reflects the speed of the underlying beat. Together, these metrics will allow us to quanitify emotional and structural aspects of music across different seasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although valence, energy, and tempo are the core features for this project, Spotify offers a wide range of additional metrics like danceability, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, etc. These features are not used directly in the project analysis, but are part of the audio features that will be extracted.\n",

    " - [x] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> Billboard charts reflect only mainstream, comercially-focused music. This introduces bias, as independent artists and smaller genres are underrepresented. Our analysis shoud then focus on mainstream music to avoid overgeneralizing. \n",
    " - [x] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> No personally identifiable information is collected. We ensure that no user-level streaming data or private accound information is collected or incorporated when getting the feature data from Spotify. \n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> Not applicable: the dataset contains no class attributes, so no need to test for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [x] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> All data are public. API credentials are the main concern, but should be fine since they are environment variables. \n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "> Not applicable: no personal data collected. \n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> Not applicable: dataset only contains pubic chart information and features. No actual sensitive data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> The dataset excluded non-mainstream artists and genres, meaning our analysis does not capture the full diversity of musical experience across communities. So, we have to make clear that this is not a generalizable study. \n",
    " - [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> Billboard rankings are shaped by marketing, radio, and structural music industry inequalities. Findings may actually only reflect the behavior of the mainstream music industry rather than universal listeners. \n",
    " - [x] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> Spotify's music features are only proxies, not direct measures of emotions. We must be careful about visualizations and interpretations to avoid implying causal or universal emotional conclusions. \n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> Not applicable: Same reason as PII- it is not used. \n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> The analysis is reproducible, but our API still needs work with its rate-limits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [x] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> The model uses only musical features that contain no sensitive attributes, reducing proxy risk, but might still only capture mainstream musical industry movement instead. \n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> Not applicable: no human groups. \n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> Metrics reflect musical characteristics only. The emotional aspect is treated more cautiously.\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> The analysis should be descriptive rather than predictive, so explainability concerns are minimal. \n",
    " - [x] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> Limitations related to dataset bias, feature interpretations, and representativeness must clearly be comminicated to avoid overstating findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> N/A: no deployed system or decision making tool used. \n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> N/A: the project does not give outputs that could cause harm. \n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "> N/A: no production system exists, and/or we can force stop indefinite running code using datahub kernel stopper. \n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> The analysis is academic and descriptive, so nothing can really be misused apart from the findings, which is something already covered by other points. "
